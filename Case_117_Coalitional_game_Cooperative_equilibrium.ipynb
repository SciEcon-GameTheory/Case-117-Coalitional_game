The entire transaction history of Bitcoin is stored on a shared data structure called the block chain. Every block in the block chain contains a set of the recent transactions it approves. In addition, its header contains, among other meta-data fields, a pointer to its predecessor in the block chain, a compressed representation of its transaction set, and a \"nonce\" field which acts as a proof of work.

Intuitively, $v(C)$ is the total utility that the members in $C \\subseteq I$ can gain by working together. The characteristic function describes the total payoff of every coalition, but it does not prescribe a way of distributing these payoffs among the agents in the coalition. Such a division is called an imputation. An imputation is a vector $x \\in \\Re^{|I|}$ that divides the gains of the grand coalition I among all the agents, where $\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{i}=v(I)$ and $x_{i} \\geq 0$ is the payoff of player $i$. The most prominent solution concept that describes stability in coalitional games is the core $ .$ An imputation $x$ is blocked by some coalition $B \\subseteq I$ if the members of $B$ can abandon the grand coalition and achieve a higher utility, by working as a group of their own, than the share currently allocated to them; that is, $v(B)>\\sum_{i \\in B} x_{i} .$ An imputation $x$ is in the core if it is not blocked by any coalition, i.e., for any coalition $C \\subset I$ we have that $x(C) \\geq v(C)$ (where $\\left.x(C)=\\sum_{i \\in C} x_{i}\\right)$.\n",

        "In many domains several teams may form, creating a structure of coalitions. Cooperative games with Coalition Structures have been used by artificial intelligence researchers to model agent collaboration and team formation $[21,39,40$, 42]. A coalition structure is a partition of the agent set $I$ into disjoint sets called teams. That is, $\\mathcal{S}=\\left\\{C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{m}\\right\\}$ is a coalition structure over $I$ iff $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} C_{i}=I$ and for all $i \\neq j$, $C_{i} \\cap C_{j}=\\emptyset .$ We denote by $\\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{S}(I)$ the set of all possible coalition structures over $I .$ In some settings, the value of a coalition depends on the structure of the other coalitions. A cooperative game with coalition structures is defined by a partition function [33] that takes as input a coalition structure $\\mathcal{S} \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{S}(I)$ and a coalition $C \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and outputs a value $v(\\mathcal{S}, C)=v_{\\mathcal{S}}(C)$, i.e., it determines the utility of a coalition $C$ under the partition of other agents, as given by $\\mathcal{S}$. Similar to transferable utility coalitional games, agents need to divide the gains of each team in the coalition structure. An imputation associated with $\\mathcal{S}$ is a vector $x \\in \\Re^{|I|}$ such that for all $i \\in I, x_{i} \\geq 0$, and for every $C \\in \\mathcal{S}$ it holds that $x(C)=v_{\\mathcal{S}}(C)$. An imputation associated with $\\mathcal{S}$ is in the CS-core of $\\mathcal{S}$ if for every $C \\subset I$ we have $x(C) \\geq v_{\\mathcal{S}_{C}}(C)$, where $\\mathcal{S}_{C}=\\{C\\} \\cup\\{\\{D \\backslash C\\}: D \\in \\mathcal{S}, D \\backslash C \\neq \\emptyset\\} .$ Intuitively,\n",

Hence, if miner $i$ in pool $C_{j}$ mined block $B$ at time $t$, then at time $t+d$ her pool manager knows $B$ was mined. At this point, if $B$ extends the longest chain then the pool manager publishes it to the rest of the network, and updates its participants about the header of the next block to mine. Upon which, at time $t+2 d$ the other miners in pool $C_{j}$ will learn of $B$, and at time $t+d+D$ the other pool managers and solo miners will learn of $B$.

Unfortunately, the topology of the Bitcoin miner network is unknown and keeps changing. To avoid the intractable analysis of the general case, where any topology is possible, we deviate from the coalition structure setup, and model instead the miner and pool interactions as a transferable utility coalitional game. In these games, the value of a coalition depends solely on the members of that coalition, with no dependence on the other players. To adapt this model to the Bitcoin world, where inter-pool effects are possible, we allow only one coalition to form, and fix the topology of its environment as one which consists of solo miners only.\n",

The free parameter $\\lambda$ is set so as to satisfy $\\beta\\left(\\Gamma_{2}\\right)=\\beta$, where $\\beta\\left(\\Gamma_{2}\\right)$ is given by Equation 1.

The growth rate of the longest chain, in the sub-network of the pool, is $\\alpha_{C}$, as shown in Lemma $2 .$ The sub-network representing the solo miners is a symmetric network with $m=|\\mathcal{M} \\backslash C|$ miners, and its longest chain's growth rate can be approximated by $\\lambda \\frac{m+D \\lambda}{m+m D \\lambda}$ (see Section 7 for further discussion). Putting $m=n-|C|$ we arrive at $\\alpha_{S}$. Combining these two sub-networks, and approximating their operations as following Poisson processes (with parameters $\\alpha_{C}$ and $\\alpha_{S}$ respectively), we can extract from Equation 2 an estimate for $\\gamma_{C} .$ Simulation results presented in the next section suggest that this approximation can be done safely, as it underestimates the pool's actual value, and the instability is reached even under weaker conditions.\n",
